# web-dev-project
This project was part of my assessment for my web development module, it involved creating a full stack website with the theme around "moodtracking".
The backend REST API was developed using NodeJS/Express and is complete with JWT authentication. The DB Schema is also available within the moodsdb.sql file.
The frontend UI was developed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (Vanilla and jQuery).
