# web-dev-project
This project was part of my assessment for my web development module, it involved creating a full stack website with the theme of helping users track their moods.
The website allows the user to log moods and records the time the mood was logged, as well as a mood score (1-5) and additional feelings if applicable, this information is then stored with a SQL database.
The users data is then presented in a range of formats, including using data tables and charts with the help of Chart.js.
The backend REST API was developed using NodeJS/Express and is complete with JWT authentication. The DB Schema is also available within the moodsdb.sql file.
The frontend UI was developed using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (Vanilla and jQuery).

To access the UI:
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
The UI is accessed on http://localhost:3000
